# Modeling and Simulation Samples
A sampling of various analytical and numerical models and simulations, ranging from the newtonion physics of a slinky drop, to the simulation of 2D excitable systems with the FitzHugh-Nagumo Model. Some examples can be seen below. There is also a helpful guide to Unix for beginner's that I created to brush up on my Unix when the occassions arise.

Many masses, each connected by a spring:
